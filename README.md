Reflection
==========

This program was written in Netbeans. It used GLSL shader to simuluate reflection and refraction of the environment 
(which is a cubeMap in our case). I am a beginner in GLSL. It took me a while to get it function well. 

Check out the result:
Reflection
Refraction
Half reflection and half refraction
